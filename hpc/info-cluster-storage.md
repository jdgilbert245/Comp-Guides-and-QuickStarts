# Info about cluster storage
All clusters have their own policies about storage/compute limits and processes for requestion extensions.

## Myriad
Scratch is limited to 1TB by default. Can be extended to 5TB at the discretion of myriad support team. Beyond 5TB, users must complete a [CRAG form](https://www.rc.ucl.ac.uk/docs/Additional_Resource_Requests/). Both written requests below 5TB and requests via CRAG form should go to `rc-support@ucl.ac.uk`. 

NOTE: Myriad is not backed up- do not treat anything there as safe!
