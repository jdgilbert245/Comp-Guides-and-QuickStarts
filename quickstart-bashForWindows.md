# Bash for Windows
Guide for installing bash terminal functionality on _managed_ Windows machine.

You can't follow general instructions that need you to run a bash executable file (.exe). Git gui is available from the [UCL Application Store](https://apps-store.ucl.ac.uk/). 

This installs Git and a Git Bash shell can be opened from the search menu. It can also be opened in e.g. Visual Studio Code.

## Performance
It is very slow and laggy :')
