# Computational Guides and Quick Starts
This is mostly a place for me to store notes on useful computational stuff.

Not very neat or comprehensive. At some point, it would be nice to make a curated guide for things that are tricky or not covered elsewhere. Don't have time at the moment.

Absolutely not intended for education or for others to use in currect form.

If you find anything interesting or want to discuss: james.d.gilbert@ucl.ac.uk.
