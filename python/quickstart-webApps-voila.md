# Python Web Apps
We may wish to display our python notebooks as web apps that can be adjusted without the need to know Python or how to navigate a Jupyter Notebook. Voila is one solution.

## Voila

### Usage
Activate conda env `py_voila_webapp`. Can be recreated from yaml file.

Note that for voila to work, all required packages have to be installed _within the conda environment_ that is active while running voila.
